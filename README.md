### Folder Structure

When you have the project locally - note that the project contents as in assets i worked on reside inside the ```src folder
there is index.js and style.css``` - i have manually created my index page instead of having an HTML loader and for that reason the html code resides in ``` Dist/index.html```

### Resources Used

To compress the images i used ```Image Resize - TinyPNG``` could have make use of Photoshop but i dont have it locally. I used stock images from ```https://unsplash.com/s/photos/ ```
